      <p class="gojira4">
        During the 1980s, each of the future members of Tool moved to Los
        Angeles. Both Paul D'Amour and Adam Jones wanted to enter the film
        industry, while Maynard James Keenan found employment remodeling pet
        stores after having studied visual arts in Michigan. Danny Carey and
        Keenan performed for Green Jell√ø, and Carey played with Carole King and
        Pigmy Love Circus. Keenan and Jones met through a mutual friend in 1989.
        After Keenan played a tape recording for Jones of his previous band
        project, Jones was so impressed by his voice that he eventually talked
        his friend into forming a new band. They started jamming together while
        searching for a drummer and a bass player. Carey happened to live above
        Keenan and was introduced to Jones by Tom Morello, an old high school
        friend of Jones and former member of Electric Sheep. Carey began playing
        in their sessions because he "felt kinda sorry for them," as other
        invited musicians were not showing up. Tool's lineup was completed when
        a friend of Jones introduced them to bassist D'Amour. Early on, the band
        fabricated the story that they formed because of the pseudophilosophy
        "lachrymology". Although "lachrymology" was also cited as an inspiration
        for the band's name, Keenan later explained their intentions
        differently: "Tool is exactly what it sounds like: It's a big dick. It's
        a wrench. ... we are ... your tool; use us as a catalyst in your process
        of finding out whatever it is you need to find out, or whatever it is
        you're trying to achieve
