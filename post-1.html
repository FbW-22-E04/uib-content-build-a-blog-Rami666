        Gojira tends to operate in polar extremes. “I can’t help but see
        humanity as a parasite,” Gojira’s co-founding guitarist and principal
        songwriter Joe Duplantier explains, “and yet the most beautiful things
        come out of humans.” To that end, the French quartet—Duplantier and his
        brother Mario [drums], Christian Andreu [guitar], and Jean-Michel
        Labadie [bass]—have spent the past 15 years translating this duality

        success—through a singular commitment to self-reflection. The intensely

        mother, was a painful significant turning point for the French group. It
        debuted at No. 24 on the Billboard 200 chart, topped the Billboard “Hard
        Rock Albums” chart (a first for a French band), and netted nominations
        for Best Rock Album and Best Metal Performance (for "Silvera") at the
        59th annual Grammy Awards. Numerous global headlining tours, including a
        stint with Metallica, followed. Coming out of Magma, Gojira weren't just
        one of the biggest metal bands on the scene—they were one of biggest
        rock bands in the world, unified
