        <p class="p2">
          Gojira is a French heavy metal band from Ondres. Founded as Godzilla
          in 1996, the band's lineup—brothers Joe (lead vocals, rhythm guitar)
          and Mario Duplantier (drums), Christian Andreu (lead guitar), and
          Jean-Michel Labadie (bass)—has been the same since the band changed
          its name to Gojira in 2001. Gojira has been known for their
          progressive and technical death metal styles and their spiritual and
          environmentally-themed lyrics. The band has gone "from the utmost
          obscurity during the first half of their career to widespread global
          recognition in the second".

          Massive Attack are an English trip hop collective formed in 1988 in
          Bristol by Robert "3D" Del Naja, Adrian "Tricky" Thaws, Andrew
          "Mushroom" Vowles and Grant "Daddy G" Marshall. The band currently
          consists of Del Naja, Thaws and Marshall, with Shara Nelson and Horace
          Andy as guest vocalists. The debut Massive Attack album Blue Lines was
          released in 1991, with the single "Unfinished Sympathy" reaching the
          charts and later being voted the 63rd greatest song of all time in a
          poll by NME.[2] 1998's Mezzanine (containing the top 10 single
          "Teardrop") and 2003's 100th Window charted in the UK at number one.
          Both Blue Lines and Mezzanine feature in Rolling Stone's list of the
          500 Greatest Albums of All Time.

          Tool is an American rock band from Los Angeles. Formed in 1990, the
          group's line-up includes vocalist Maynard James Keenan, guitarist Adam
          Jones and drummer Danny Carey. Justin Chancellor has been the band's
          bassist since 1995, replacing their original bassist Paul D'Amour.
          Tool has won four Grammy Awards, performed worldwide tours, and
          produced albums topping the charts in several countries. To date, the
          band has released five studio albums, one EP and one box set. They
          emerged with a heavy metal sound on their first studio album, Undertow
          (1993), and became a dominant act in the alternative metal movement
          with the release of their follow-up album Ænima in 1996. Their efforts
          to unify musical experimentation, visual arts, and a message of
          personal evolution continued with Lateralus (2001) and 10,000 Days
          (2006), gaining critical acclaim and international commercial success.
          Their fifth studio album, Fear Inoculum, was released on August 30,
          2019, to widespread critical acclaim. Prior to its release, the band
          had sold more than 13 million albums in the US alone.[1]
