        Massive Attack started as a spin-off production quartet in 1988, with
        the independently released song, "Any Love", sung by falsetto-voiced
        singer-songwriter Carlton McCarthy, and then, with considerable backing
        from Neneh Cherry, they signed to Circa Records[9] in 1990â€”committing to
        deliver six studio albums and a "best of" compilation. Circa became a
        subsidiary of, and was later subsumed into, Virgin Records, which in
        turn was acquired by EMI. Blue Lines (1991), was co-produced by Jonny
        Dollar and Cameron McVey, who also became their first manager.[12] McVey
        (credited at the time as 'Booga Bear') and his wife, Neneh Cherry,
        provided crucial financial support and in-kind assistance to the early
        careers of Massive Attack, Portishead and Tricky during this period,
        even paying regular wages to them through their Cherry Bear
        organisation. Massive Attack used guest vocalists, interspersed with
        their own sprechgesang stylings, on top of what became regarded as an
        essentially British creative sampling production; a trademark sound that
        fused down-tempo hip hop, soul, reggae and other eclectic references,
        musical and lyrical. In the 1990s, the members worked increasingly
        separately. Adrian "Tricky" Thaws left Massive Attack in 1995 and Andrew
        Vowles (Mushroom) left Massive Attack in late 1999. Despite having taken
        Del Naja's side and participating in a webcast as a duo the following
        year, Grant Marshall (Daddy G) took a personal break in 2001. Marshall
        rejoined the band for their following tour in 2003 and 2004, and
        returned to a studio role in 2005, and also Thaws rejoined Massive
        Attack in early 2016.
